# Typing Test
This project was started because the typing practice services I've tried all annoy me in some one or another. Since this is a Kotlin Multiplatform project, it will target multiple platforms, including native/local instances, as well as a web version to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Modes of Entry
Each mode of entry allows the following options.

| Option      | Values    | Description                                                                    |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feedback    | On, Off   | Controls whether mismatched characters are displayed as feedback for the user. |
| Termination | Length, ? | Controls how text entry is terminated.                                         |
|             |           |                                                                                |


### Single Word
This mode will present the user with a collection of words, one at a time.

### Paragraph
